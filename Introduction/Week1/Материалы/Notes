We recommend you the following options:

Coursera Notebooks (cloud). It's CPU only, but it has versions of the libraries that were tested to work with our Notebooks. It's a docker container on a shared cluster, so performance may degrade if many learners use it heavily. It's a safe choice, but can be slow.

Google Colab (cloud). It's Jupyter Notebooks from Google. The great thing about them is that they provide free GPUs as of August 2018. It has the latest version of TensorFlow and some things may change in future TensorFlow versions, so you need to be prepared to file an issue on our GitHub or on forums so that we can upgrade our Notebooks. As of August 2018 all our Notebooks are compatible with Google Colab. It's pretty easy to start working on Colab, just follow our instructions: https://github.com/hse-aml/intro-to-dl#running-on-google-colab-tested-for-all-weeks

Your own hardware. If you have a powerful computer at home you may end up with your own offline setup, please follow the instructions here: https://github.com/hse-aml/intro-to-dl#offline-instructions
